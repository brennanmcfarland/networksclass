Snippets of code from stuff I may add in the future, but couldn't quite get
working right by the deadline:

//TODO: put this in a separate function
//this is for future potential use, but it doesn't quite work right atm
/*
else if(strncmp(userinputbuffer, "write ", sizeof("write ")-1) == 0)
{
  char *filename = userinputbuffer+sizeof("write");
  //notify the server that it is about to receive a file
  sendcommandmessage(CMDID_WRITEFILE, FALSE, filename);
  //read the contents of the file into filecontents
  FILE *sendingfilestream;
  char filepath[strlen(filename)+strlen(FILESDIRECTORY)];
  filepath[0] = '\0';
  strcat((char *)filepath, FILESDIRECTORY);
  strcat((char *)filepath, filename);
  filepath[strlen(filepath)-1] = '\0';

  safefileopen(&sendingfilestream, filepath, 'r');
  safefileread(sendingfilestream, filecontents, MAXFILEREADSIZE);
  //and send it over the network
  sendfile(filename, textoutputbuffer, filecontents,
    sd, FILESDIRECTORY);
}*/


things to test for:
  X reading empty file
  --  reading overly large file
    all buffer overflows, including
    X  user input
    X  user output
    X  text input
    X  text output
    X  command field input
    X all possible combinations of commands, multiple times on different files
    X multiple connections (serially)
  X headers
  check everything on the sheet
  X change executable names
  TEST ON THE SERVER
  X replace constants
  go over style one more time
  don't forget the report!
