Mark Allman is an amazing professor.  He is great at teaching networks,
is available to help students and really knows his stuff.  I would not
be surprised if it turned out Mark Allman secretly owns the internet.
Actually yes, I would be, but not as much as most other people.  He also
loves to give out As to his enthusiastic students (hint hint).
