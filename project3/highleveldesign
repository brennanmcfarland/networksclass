struct for meta info
  2 unsigned longs (sec+msec), 2 unsigned shorts (caplen, ignored)

main loop; for each packet:
  read 1st 12 bytes of packet into struct
  numbytescapturedinpacket <- ntohs(caplen(bytes 9-10))
  numpackets++
  if first packet in sequence then
    record time in ?
  record time as last packet's time in ?
  read caplen bytes from trace into buffer
  [will add more later, for now just ignore rest of buffer to get -s working
  to ensure the base functionality, then add other features on top as
  specified in the assignment sheet]
