struct for meta info
  12 unsigned longs (or chars, size = 1 byte?)

main loop; for each packet:
  read 1st 12 bytes of packet into struct
  numbytescapturedinpacket <- ntohs(caplen(bytes 9-10))
  numpackets++
  if first packet in sequence then
    record time in ?
  record time as last packet's time in ?
  read caplen bytes from trace into buffer
